Task 1. Explore the default network
Delete the default network
Task 2. Create a VPC network and VM instances
In the console, navigate to Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon) > VPC network > VPC networks, and then click +CREATE VPC NETWORK.

Set the Name to mynetwork.

For Subnet creation mode, click Automatic.

Auto mode networks create subnets in each region automatically.

For Firewall rules, check all available rules.

These are the same standard firewall rules that the default network had.

Note: The deny-all-ingress and allow-all-egress rules are also displayed, but you cannot check or uncheck them as they are implied. These two rules have a lower Priority (higher integers indicate lower priorities) so that the allow ICMP, custom, RDP and SSH rules are considered first.
Click CREATE, then wait for mynetwork to be created.

Notice that a subnet was created for each region.

Click on the mynetwork name and record the IP address range for the subnets in REGION and REGION. Refer to these in the next steps.
